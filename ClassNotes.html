				<h2 class="stage">Stage 1: Make Your Web Page</h2>
				<div class=stage1>
				HTML - <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> - the standard markup language used to create web pages.<br>
				<br>
				HTML Elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.  Elements are usually made up of an opening and closing tag.  Each element
				tells the browser information that is between the opening and closing tag.<br>
				<br>
				Tags are currently refered to as elements.<br>
				<br>
				CSS - <em>"Cascading Style Sheets"</em> - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.<br>
				<br>
				CSS allows you to create rules that specifies how the content will apper.<br>
				<br>
				Using special text editors like sublime, scratchpadio, and codepen make programming easier.<br>
				<br>
				CSS is used to change font types, font size, background colors, font colors, margins, padding, borders, font-alignment....etc <br>
				<br>
				Structure in HTML - described as "tree-like-structure" - means that elements can have other elements inside of them.  When looking at the code you can see this as indentions.<br> 
				<br>
				Don't duplicate yourself.  The more duplication within code make is harder to maintain and makes it more difficult to realize that if a change is made in one location it may have to be made in another.<br>
				<br>
				Anything written between the <b>title</b> tag will appear in the title bar of the browser.<br>
				<br>
				Everthing inside the <b>body</b> tag will be shown inside the main browser.<br>
				<br>	
				<u><b>HTML Tags (Examples)</b></u><br>
					em- italics<br>
					b - bold<br>
					u - underline<br>
					a href - add a link<br>
					img src= alt= - add a image<br>
					p - paragraph<br>
					br - break<br>
					li - line item <br>

					<div class="Stage_2">
					Python - Python is a programming language.  A <i>Python Interpreter</i> converts the programming code as a set of instructions for the computer to understand.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					An <b>expression</b> is something that has value.  To introduce a new value use an <b>assignment statement</b>.  Ex.... Name=Expression
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					<b>Functions</b> - a function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform an action.  You can defind a function to provide added functionality.  Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by parentheses() and any input paramenter should be put withing these parentheses.  Ex.... <b>def</b> <i>function (paramenter):</i>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					<b>Variables</b> - is a name that refers to a value.  Variables store data and allow us to write the code in a way that makes it understandable. We can assign a value to the variable and be able to manipulate the value when needed.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					For Loops allow you to iterate over list or string.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					<b>Strings</b> - a string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.  You can use operators on stringes such as + and *.  These operators have a different meaning in strings than intergers, with strings it means concatenate.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					Indexing a string is selecting a sub-sequence from the string you can do this by using square brackets[] on the part of the string you want to select.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					You can use find to locate information within a string. Ex....<i>search string</i>.<b>find</b>(<i>target string</i>).  You can also put in a number to search from a certain position of the string.  Ex....<i>searchstring</i>.<b>find</b>(<i>target string, number</i>)
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_2">
					<b>Lists</b> - list is a datatype that can be written as a list of comma-seperated values between square brackets. List are very versatile and can be indexed, updated, and mutated.

				<h2 class="stage">Stage 3: Adding Videos To Your Page</h2>
				<div class="Stage_3">
					OOP - <b>Object Oriented Programming</b> - is about reusing code. In stead of changing code or starting from scratch it is easier to customize the code that already exist therefore minimizing redundancy.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					Modules package program code and data for reuse.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					<b>Classes</b> - classes are designed to create new objects that support inheritance.  Classes are created by using the statement <i>"class"</i>.  Classes are always inside modules
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					Instances - instances are created by calling class as if it were a function.  Each instance object inherits class attributes.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					Normally all instance attributes are initialized in the __init__constructor method.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					<b>Attributes</b> are usually attached to instance by assignments to the argument passed to functions coded inside classes, called self.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					The __init__ method is known as the constructor because of when it is run.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					 <b>Inheritance</b> chooses the first occurrence of an attribute it finds when an attribute is referenced normally - by self.method() for example.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					 Class Variables are associated within a Class.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					 <b>Loops</b> - code loops allow you to read one or more inputs.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					 Python comes with a collection of prebuilt functionality known as the <b>standard library</b>. The standard library supports many different types of programming task.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="notes">
					<div class="Stage_3">
					 Abstraction allows getting things done much easier.  In programming, abstractions can make or break productivity. Commonly used functions are collected into libraries which can be reused by others.
					 There are similarties between OOP and HTML/CSS.  The biggest similarities to me is reusing code and not duplicating your work.  Using classes in HTML allows you to use that class in CSS to style your
					 work and effect everything under that class without having to duplicate what you have done.  Both HTML and OOP use a <i>"tree like structer"</i> when coding.
